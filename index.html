              <h1>Dr. (H.C.) Ir. H. Soekarno</h1>
              <h2>Hero of the Proclamation of Indonesian Independence .</h2>
              <p>
                an Indonesian statesman, politician, nationalist and revolutionary who
                was the first president of Indonesia, serving from 1945 to 1967.</br></p>
                <p>Sukarno was the leader of the Indonesian struggle for independence from the Dutch colonialists. He was a
                  prominent leader of Indonesia's nationalist movement during the colonial period and spent over a decade under
                  Dutch detention until released by the invading Japanese forces in World War II.</p>
                <p>Sukarno and his fellow nationalists collaborated to garner support for the Japanese war effort from the
                population, in exchange for Japanese aid in spreading nationalist ideas. Upon Japanese surrender, Sukarno and
                Mohammad Hatta declared Indonesian independence on 17 August 1945, and Sukarno was appointed as its president.
                He led Indonesians in resisting Dutch re-colonisation efforts via diplomatic and military means until the Dutch
                recognition of Indonesian independence in 1949.</p>
                <p>Author Pramoedya Ananta Toer once wrote, "Sukarno was the only Asian leader of the modern era able to unify
                people of such differing ethnic, cultural and religious backgrounds without shedding a drop of blood."

        <h1>Independence struggle</h1>
        <p>Sukarno with his friends from the Algemeene Studieclub established a pro-independence party, the Indonesian National Party (PNI), of which Sukarno was elected the first leader. The party advocated independence for Indonesia, and opposed imperialism and capitalism because it opined that both systems worsened the life of Indonesian people. The party also advocated secularism and unity amongst the many different ethnicities in the Dutch East Indies, to establish a united Indonesia. </p>

        <h1>Proclamation</h1>
        <p>Sukarno returned to his house at Jalan Pegangsaan Timur No. 56, where Mohammad Hatta joined him. Throughout the morning, impromptu leaflets printed by PETA and youth elements informed the population of the impending proclamation. Finally, at 10 am, Sukarno and Hatta stepped to the front porch, where Sukarno declared the independence of the Republic of Indonesia in front of a crowd of 500 people. This most historic of buildings had, however, been ordered to be demolished by Sukarno himself, without any apparent reason.</p>
